  **SPEED PRESENTATIONS**
  <br><br>
  Each speed presentation will be allocated a 5-minute slot, including 4 minutes of presentation and 1 minute for a question and transition to the next speaker. Please pre-automate your slide progression before sending it to us with your preferred timings per slide and we will add it to the slideshow queue. Please keep the presentation at 12 slides or less and 4 minutes or less. For instructions on how to set automated slide changes, see the "Set a time to advance to the next slide" section <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Set-the-timing-and-speed-of-a-transition-C3C3C66F-4CCA-4821-B8B9-7DE0F3F6EAD1">here</a>. If you prefer, prepare a presentation with 12 slides and we are happy to automate the presentation for you at 20 seconds per slide. Presentations must be in .ppt or .pptx, in the Standard (4:3) format. Final presentations must be sent to info@efp-psgb2019.com by Aug. 30, 2019.

  **POSTER PRESENTATIONS**
  <br><br>
  All posters must be in A0 Portrait format. Due to the space requirements we are not able to accommodate any other formats. Presenters are expected to print and bring their poster with them to the meeting and are responsible for hanging their own poster on the designated board on **Monday, Sep. 9**, and for removing them by the end of the day on **Tuesday, Sep. 10**. The poster session will be run from 5:30pm - 7pm on **Monday, Sept 9** with all presenting throughout. 
  <br><br>
  There are two nearby poster printing locations in Oxford: <a href="https://www.brookes.ac.uk/brookes-print/">Brookes Print</a> (for Oxford Brookes), and <a href="https://www.oxford-print-centre.co.uk/">Oxford Print Centre</a> (for the city centre/Maths Institute). If you choose to use these services, we recommend that you contact them in advance to ensure that your poster is printed and ready to be picked up on time for your presentation.
