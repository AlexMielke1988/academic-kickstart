      <title>Cognition and Culture in Chimpanzee Play</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Funded by the British Academy and with mentorship by Dr Susana Carvalho in Oxford, this project will ask whether primate play can provide a window into the evolution of complex cognition. 
Human and animal lives differ so widely that comparative cognitive research struggles to find contexts in which to compare their 
intelligence directly. Researchers often create experiments to study animal minds in captive settings, but 
while these experiments are repeatable in humans and other species, they rarely represent challenges that 
animals face in their natural environment. Chimpanzees have been at the centre of this endeavour, as they are one of our closest relatives and show a number of cognitive abilities that 
resemble ours, while apparently lacking some of our higher cognitive functions. Finding a 
context in which direct comparisons between humans and free-ranging primates are possible is essential 
to understand how our mind differs from that of other species. One behaviour is highly similar in humans 
and other primates in form and function and has a clear link to cognitive development: In play, we reveal 
the whole extent of our creativity, imagination, flexibility, and our abilities to adjust to others and learn from 
them. Playâ€™s foremost importance for child development is undeniable and it infuses all aspects of our 
adult life, making it one of the main predictors of human well-being and friendships. It has long been central 
to anthropological and psychological enquiries. The importance of adult play in humans is 
unique, but chimpanzees play extensively throughout their development, allowing direct species 
comparisons. Playing is key in acquiring social, technical, communicative and motor skills in primates, enabling juveniles to test new solutions flexibly in changing scenarios. Unlike other cooperative 
behaviours, the cognition involved in play remains largely unexplored, as researchers have focused on 
determining its function and impact on survival. If play is a preparation for the challenges individuals face 
over their lifespan, it is a magnifying lens of the cognitive flexibility in a species. Thus, using natural 
observations of play allows us to investigate the evolution of human cognitive development. At the same 
time, play is possibly the only context in which we can compare captive and wild chimpanzee populations 
in their cognitive development and well-being, providing a unique tool to test the impact of captivity on 
development and welfare. I will use play in juvenile wild and captive chimpanzees to understand their abilities to learn complex interaction rules, to flexibly and rapidly adapt to 
different roles and synchronise with others, and to create and transmit cultural traditions within communities. 
I will thereby open up a new comparative approach to the study of higher cognitive functions using 
natural observations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>NetFACS</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project, awarded to Jerome Micheletta, Bridget Waller, and Julie Duboscq by the Leverhulme Trust, uses network science to untangle the complexity of primate and human facial expression. Facial expressions are the most ubiquitous form of communication in many primate species; they are also the most ephemeral: fleeting and flexible; hard to film and harder to quantify. 
The last decades have brought advances in capturing the information content of facial communication, namely the adaptation of the muscle-based Facial Action Coding System (FACS), with automated solutions always just a step away. 
However, statistical approaches to extract meaning from the wealth of data have not been forthcoming. I helped develop &amp;lsquo;NetFACS&amp;rsquo;, an open access statistical tool (available on GitHub for R) that treats facial muscles as nodes in different types of networks to elucidate their connections with each other, but also their functions in different communicative contexts. 
NetFACS allows us to study facial expressions not simply as static displays, but as dynamic signals with which individuals convey situation-specific information. NetFACS will soon be available on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Primate Communication</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My research has focused on communication, its function, and the development of new methods and theoretical frameworks throughout my career. 
I started by programming an algorithm, based on neural networks, that could be trained to identify individual blue monkeys by their alarm calls, and also tell apart different call types and species (Mielke &amp;amp; Zuberbuehler 2013).
We subsequently applied the same method to learned orangutan vocalisations, showing the Rocky, an orangutan in Indianapolis Zoo, had learned to make &amp;lsquo;wookie&amp;rsquo; sounds that were distinct from any other vocalisation in the orangutan repertoire (Lameira et al. 2016).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of my PhD, I scared sooty mangabeys with (relatively) life-like models of Gaboon vipers, made from paper mache. Besides being wildly entertaining, this study allowed us to test different theories of how cooperative alarm calling evolves. 
Gaboon vipers are a threat to sooty mangabeys, but only as long as you don&#39;t know where the snake is hiding. Monkeys do not actively chase off the snake, as they do with leopards or eagles. Therefore, if a monkey calls, it is probably to inform others. But whom do they inform?
Our results show that mangabeys did not call specifically for family members, friends, or ignorant group members; instead, they called when the information about the location of the snake would otherwise be lost to the group. 
We saw a lot of calls when individuals were around the snake in small groups, but not when they were in large groups. Thus, we concluded that the social system of these mangabeys, living in large well-connected groups, reduces the responsibility for each individual. 
They do not have to wait around the snake, and not everyone has to call; as long as you are alone with the snake and you call, all subsequent individuals will be informed, and you can be on your way again.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mangabey and Chimpanzee Cooperation and Cognition</title>
      <link>/project/mangabey-and-chimpanzee-sociality/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/project/mangabey-and-chimpanzee-sociality/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I spent three field seasons, from 2013 to 2015, in the Tai Forest, Ivory Coast, to study sooty mangabeys and Western chimpanzees and try to define what, if anything, makes chimpanzee sociality special, and what impact this has on cognitive abilities. 
While we know a lot about chimpanzee behaviour, sooty mangabeys had received little attention, despite living terrestrialy in large and complex social groups. 
Splitting my time between one chimpanzee and one mangabey community, I collected the same data in both species to enable us to compare them directly. 
Through collaboration with my colleagues Anna Preis and Liran Samuni (for the chimpanzees), and Jan Gogarten and Clement Gba (for the mangabeys), and with the invaluable help of the dedicated field assistants of the Tai Chimpanzee Project, we were able to illuminate previously unknown cognitive abilities in both species and shed further life on the way cooperation shapes their everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One result of the immediate comparison of the two species was that both of them rely heavily on their cooperative partners, and they make complex choices every day to figure out with whom to cooperate. They also protect their relationships against competition. 
Both chimpanzees and mangabeys select partners for grooming interactions out of a pool of available group members, and choose while considering a large number of characteristics at the same time: their rank, age, sex, whether they have a baby or not, their previous interactions with each other, but also based on who else is around. 
If friends of an individual are present, who are likely to disrupt the grooming interactions, that individual is a much less attractive grooming partner (Mielke et al. 2018). 
We later showed in chimpanzees that food sharing is similarly the results of a multidimensional choice based on partner characteristics and past cooperative interactions (Samuni et al. 2018).
After having made such an effort to find someone to cooperate with, individuals in both species make sure that their friends do not cheat on them, by intervening to disrupt their ongoing grooming interactions (Mielke et al. 2017). 
Interventions are also used strategically to prevent close-ranked competitors from making new alliances. 
In a separate study on the hormonal correlates of reconciliation after fights, we showed that chimpanzees have a number of different ways to make up with their friends after a disagreement (Preis et al. 2018). Also, we could show that one reason for the importance of cooperation in chimpanzees is the competition between neighbouring communities, who fight over territory and resources (Samuni et al. 2019).
The reason we find few differences between species in these studies is likely that all anthropoid primates are very attuned to their social environment, because living in large groups puts a lot of pressure on successfully processing information about other group members&amp;rsquo; behaviour. While the skills of both mangabeys and chimpanzees in the cooperative context are among the most complex abilities found in any animal species, they likely only scratch the surface of all the calculations these animals have to make on a daily bases when it comes to coordinating their life with that of dozens of friends, family, and foes, who all have their own history and interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite all the similarities, the two species differ in some aspects. In an upcoming book chapter, we show that mangabeys&amp;rsquo; social relationships are generally more stable than those of chimpanzees, likely because their friendships are based on rank and kinship, which are highly stable in sooty mangabeys (Wittig et al. forthcoming). The dominance hierarchy of female chimpanzees, which is highly stable in East African chimpanzees, seems to be more flexible in Tai: while rank changes are rare, they do occur and potentially allow females to jostle for positions of power (Mielke et al. 2019).
Also, the way groups move around the forest is different between the two species and creates different pressures regarding group coordination and information transfer. Chimpanzees live in so-called fission-fusion societies, where the group is rarely together as a whole but splits up into smaller groups with changing compositions, spread over large swaths of the forest.
When faced with extremely threatening paper-mache snakes, chimpanzees will remain close to the snake and call out when new individuals arrive, because this is the most accurate way to warn others of the threat. Mangabeys, who move around the forest in large groups that are generally cohesive, do not have to inform others personally: if you call when nobody else is close to the snake model, you can be quite sure that other group members can here you, are warned of the threat, and pass it on once they see it themselves (Mielke et al. 2019).
In an upcoming paper (Mielke et al. 2020, Animal Behaviour), we show that mangabeys can probably never predict the exact the identity of everyone who will be close-by, because there is no clear subgrouping going on an any group member can be anywhere in the group at any time. 
This is very different from the stable subgroups of chimpanzees, and potentially makes it difficult for mangabeys to plan ahead. However, we also show that this problem is alleviated by the fact that mangabeys cluster based on age, sex, kinship, and rank: so, while I cannot predict which subadult males will be together at any given point, if I see one subadult male I can be reasonably sure that some of the others are not too far off. So while chimpanzees have a very accurate idea about who is with them at any time, mangabeys have to make do with a probabilistic representation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, our work with the mangabeys has also led to more insights into the biology and behaviour of these fascinating and understudied primates. Jan Gogarten and colleagues could show that group membership and kin relations influence how similar the microbiomes of individual mangabeys in our group are (Gogarten et al. 2018), and that pathogen-carrying flies follow the mangabey group around over relatively long distances (Gogarten et al. 2019). 
In two upcoming papers, spearheaded by Clement Gba, we show that mangabey males have an important impact on feeding competition in the community, and that high-ranking individuals are more likely to be in the centre of the group and therefore spend less time being vigilant and more time eating. 
All in all, with now 7 years of longterm behavioural and genealogical data and a large number of biological samples available, our mangabey groups is a thriving environment for future research on primate sociality and biology.&lt;/p&gt;
