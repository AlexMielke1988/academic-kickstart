Human and animal lives differ so widely that comparative cognitive research struggles to find contexts in which to compare their intelligence directly. Researchers often create experiments to study animal minds in captive settings, but while these experiments are repeatable in humans and other species, they rarely represent challenges that animals face in their natural environment. Chimpanzees have been at the centre of this endeavour, as they are one of our closest relatives and show a number of cognitive abilities that resemble ours, while apparently lacking some of our higher cognitive functions. Finding a context in which direct comparisons between humans and free-ranging primates are possible is essential to understand how our mind differs from that of other species. One behaviour is highly similar in humans and other primates in form and function and has a clear link to cognitive development: In play, we reveal the whole extent of our creativity, imagination, flexibility, and our abilities to adjust to others and learn from them. Play’s foremost importance for child development is undeniable and it infuses all aspects of our adult life, making it one of the main predictors of human well-being and friendships. It has long been central to anthropological and psychological enquiries. The importance of adult play in humans is unique, but chimpanzees play extensively throughout their development, allowing direct species comparisons. Playing is key in acquiring social, technical, communicative and motor skills in primates, enabling juveniles to test new solutions flexibly in changing scenarios. Unlike other cooperative behaviours, the cognition involved in play remains largely unexplored, as researchers have focused on determining its function and impact on survival. If play is a preparation for the challenges individuals face over their lifespan, it is a magnifying lens of the cognitive flexibility in a species. Thus, using natural observations of play allows us to investigate the evolution of human cognitive development. At the same time, play is possibly the only context in which we can compare captive and wild chimpanzee populations in their cognitive development and well-being, providing a unique tool to test the impact of captivity on development and welfare. I will use play in juvenile wild and captive chimpanzees to understand their abilities to learn complex interaction rules, to flexibly and rapidly adapt to different roles and synchronise with others, and to create and transmit cultural traditions within communities. I will thereby open up a new comparative approach to the study of higher cognitive functions using natural observations.\n","date":1580774400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580774400,"objectID":"04d3ba0a1d499f7f1a35f0e7a6f02528","permalink":"/project/play/","publishdate":"2020-02-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/play/","section":"project","summary":"Funded by the British Academy and with mentorship by Dr Susana Carvalho in Oxford, this project will ask whether primate play can provide a window into the evolution of complex cognition.

Therefore, if a monkey calls, it is probably to inform others. But whom do they inform? Our results show that mangabeys did not call specifically for family members, friends, or ignorant group members; instead, they called when the information about the location of the snake would otherwise be lost to the group. We saw a lot of calls when individuals were around the snake in small groups, but not when they were in large groups. Thus, we concluded that the social system of these mangabeys, living in large well-connected groups, reduces the responsibility for each individual. They do not have to wait around the snake, and not everyone has to call; as long as you are alone with the snake and you call, all subsequent individuals will be informed, and you can be on your way again.\n","date":1580601600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580601600,"objectID":"9c59aedae5ee1f8d12160176a3e83c8a","permalink":"/project/primate-communication/","publishdate":"2020-02-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/primate-communication/","section":"project","summary":"My research has focused on communication, its function, and the development of new methods and theoretical frameworks throughout my career.

While we know a lot about chimpanzee behaviour, sooty mangabeys had received little attention, despite living terrestrialy in large and complex social groups. Splitting my time between one chimpanzee and one mangabey community, I collected the same data in both species to enable us to compare them directly. Through collaboration with my colleagues Anna Preis and Liran Samuni (for the chimpanzees), and Jan Gogarten and Clement Gba (for the mangabeys), and with the invaluable help of the dedicated field assistants of the Tai Chimpanzee Project, we were able to illuminate previously unknown cognitive abilities in both species and shed further life on the way cooperation shapes their everyday life.\nOne result of the immediate comparison of the two species was that both of them rely heavily on their cooperative partners, and they make complex choices every day to figure out with whom to cooperate. They also protect their relationships against competition. Both chimpanzees and mangabeys select partners for grooming interactions out of a pool of available group members, and choose while considering a large number of characteristics at the same time: their rank, age, sex, whether they have a baby or not, their previous interactions with each other, but also based on who else is around. If friends of an individual are present, who are likely to disrupt the grooming interactions, that individual is a much less attractive grooming partner (Mielke et al. 2018). We later showed in chimpanzees that food sharing is similarly the results of a multidimensional choice based on partner characteristics and past cooperative interactions (Samuni et al. 2018). After having made such an effort to find someone to cooperate with, individuals in both species make sure that their friends do not cheat on them, by intervening to disrupt their ongoing grooming interactions (Mielke et al. 2017). Interventions are also used strategically to prevent close-ranked competitors from making new alliances. In a separate study on the hormonal correlates of reconciliation after fights, we showed that chimpanzees have a number of different ways to make up with their friends after a disagreement (Preis et al. 2018). Also, we could show that one reason for the importance of cooperation in chimpanzees is the competition between neighbouring communities, who fight over territory and resources (Samuni et al. 2019). The reason we find few differences between species in these studies is likely that all anthropoid primates are very attuned to their social environment, because living in large groups puts a lot of pressure on successfully processing information about other group members\u0026rsquo; behaviour. While the skills of both mangabeys and chimpanzees in the cooperative context are among the most complex abilities found in any animal species, they likely only scratch the surface of all the calculations these animals have to make on a daily bases when it comes to coordinating their life with that of dozens of friends, family, and foes, who all have their own history and interests.\nDespite all the similarities, the two species differ in some aspects. In an upcoming book chapter, we show that mangabeys\u0026rsquo; social relationships are generally more stable than those of chimpanzees, likely because their friendships are based on rank and kinship, which are highly stable in sooty mangabeys (Wittig et al. forthcoming). The dominance hierarchy of female chimpanzees, which is highly stable in East African chimpanzees, seems to be more flexible in Tai: while rank changes are rare, they do occur and potentially allow females to jostle for positions of power (Mielke et al. 2019). Also, the way groups move around the forest is different between the two species and creates different pressures regarding group coordination and information transfer. Chimpanzees live in so-called fission-fusion societies, where the group is rarely together as a whole but splits up into smaller groups with changing compositions, spread over large swaths of the forest. When faced with extremely threatening paper-mache snakes, chimpanzees will remain close to the snake and call out when new individuals arrive, because this is the most accurate way to warn others of the threat. Mangabeys, who move around the forest in large groups that are generally cohesive, do not have to inform others personally: if you call when nobody else is close to the snake model, you can be quite sure that other group members can here you, are warned of the threat, and pass it on once they see it themselves (Mielke et al. 2019). In an upcoming paper (Mielke et al. 2020, Animal Behaviour), we show that mangabeys can probably never predict the exact the identity of everyone who will be close-by, because there is no clear subgrouping going on an any group member can be anywhere in the group at any time. This is very different from the stable subgroups of chimpanzees, and potentially makes it difficult for mangabeys to plan ahead. However, we also show that this problem is alleviated by the fact that mangabeys cluster based on age, sex, kinship, and rank: so, while I cannot predict which subadult males will be together at any given point, if I see one subadult male I can be reasonably sure that some of the others are not too far off. So while chimpanzees have a very accurate idea about who is with them at any time, mangabeys have to make do with a probabilistic representation.\nOver the years, our work with the mangabeys has also led to more insights into the biology and behaviour of these fascinating and understudied primates. Jan Gogarten and colleagues could show that group membership and kin relations influence how similar the microbiomes of individual mangabeys in our group are (Gogarten et al. 2018), and that pathogen-carrying flies follow the mangabey group around over relatively long distances (Gogarten et al. 2019). In two upcoming papers, spearheaded by Clement Gba, we show that mangabey males have an important impact on feeding competition in the community, and that high-ranking individuals are more likely to be in the centre of the group and therefore spend less time being vigilant and more time eating. All in all, with now 7 years of longterm behavioural and genealogical data and a large number of biological samples available, our mangabey groups is a thriving environment for future research on primate sociality and biology.\nPress releases: https://www.mpg.de/12125811/grooming-social-relationship\nhttps://www.mpg.de/11695920/chimpanzees-and-sooty-mangabeys-group-relationships\nhttps://www.mpg.de/12338783/wild-chimpanzees-share-food-with-their-friends\n","date":1580515200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580515200,"objectID":"d2ca283f77fcc73183e290494c5a98dc","permalink":"/project/mangabey-and-chimpanzee-sociality/","publishdate":"2020-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/mangabey-and-chimpanzee-sociality/","section":"project","summary":"I spent three field seasons, from 2013 to 2015, in the Tai Forest, Ivory Coast, to study sooty mangabeys and Western chimpanzees and try to define what, if anything, makes chimpanzee sociality special, and what impact this has on cognitive abilities.

However, when benefits are equally shared among group members, group defense becomes a collective action problem, which might subvert cohesive participation during intergroup competition. There is a lack of consensus across studies and species with regard to the link between in-group cohesion and intergroup competition, likely as a result of species differences in managing the collective action problem. Here, we examine this link in a species with a striking example of collective action during intergroup competition, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus). Using two years of focal-follow data on males and females in two groups at the Taï Forest, Côte d’Ivoire, we investigated the immediate and long-term effects of intergroup competition (border patrols and intergroup encounters) on measures of in-group cohesion, namely modularity, party size, and intergroup aggression. We found that groups’ association patterns were less modular (more cohesive) in months in which they engaged in more border patrols and intergroup encounters. We found that current and greater prior engagement in intergroup competition predicted larger party sizes. Furthermore, current, but not prior engagement in intergroup competition, predicted reduced intragroup aggression by males but not by females. Increased in-group cohesion in chimpanzees likely reduces potential costs of intergroup competition engagement, by facilitating joint participation in current and future intergroup conflicts, overcoming the collective action problem. © 2019, The Author(s).","tags":[],"title":"Intergroup Competition Enhances Chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus) In-group Cohesion","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.

This close association leads to increased levels of direct competition for resources, possibly increasing the benefit of having a higher dominance rank and challenging dominant group members. Female chimpanzees in Gombe have been shown to queue for rank rather than challenge others. Here, we show that female dyads in Taï do at times change their dominance rank, with at least six clear rank changes recorded in the Taï North and South community.

As few empirical tests of this idea exist in natural settings, we conducted a field experiment using snake models in wild sooty mangabeys, Cercocebus atys atys. We tested sooty mangabey alarm-calling patterns when exposed to viper models, investigating whether individuals called to signal fitness, to warn specific group members, or when information about the threat is not public, as would be predicted by public goods games. Strong interindividual differences in the likelihood of alarm calling existed. We found that overlap between callers was rare. Individuals were more likely to call if fewer individuals were present at the encounter site and if they had not heard other alarm calls before arriving at the site, indicating that alarm calls extended the information about the threat to following group members. This group size effect is in line with predictions of the volunteer's dilemma, a public goods game. We found no indications that individuals called specifically to warn ignorant individuals, kin or cooperation partners. Calling when information about the threat was not public allowed individuals to warn following group members while avoiding redundancy.

We observed markedly higher fly densities within both mangabey and chimpanzee groups. Using a mark–recapture experiment, we showed that flies stayed with the sooty mangabey group for up to 12 days and for up to 1.3 km. We also tested mangabey-associated flies for pathogens infecting mangabeys in this ecosystem, Bacillus cereus biovar anthracis (Bcbva), causing sylvatic anthrax, and Treponema pallidum pertenue, causing yaws. Flies contained treponemal (6/103) and Bcbva (7/103) DNA. We cultured Bcbva from all PCR-positive flies, confirming bacterial viability and suggesting that this bacterium might be transmitted and disseminated by flies. Whole genome sequences of Bcbva isolates revealed a diversity of Bcbva, probably derived from several sources.

Across 1529 decision events, multiple partner attributes (e.g. dominance ranks, social relationship quality, reproductive state, partner sex) influenced choice. Individuals preferred to initiate grooming with partners of similar global rank, but this effect was driven by a bias towards partners with a high rank compared to other locally available options. Individuals also avoided grooming partners who had strong social relationships with at least one bystander.

Here, we investigated some of the different human sharing hypotheses and potential neuroendocrine mechanisms, in one of our closest living relatives, chimpanzees. The strongest predictor of sharing across food types was the presence of enduring and mutually preferred grooming partners, more than harassment, direct signalling, or trade. Moreover, urinary oxytocin levels were higher after the sharing of both individually and jointly acquired resources compared with controls. We conclude that the emotional connection inherent in social bonds was a key factor determining sharing patterns, with the oxytocinergic system potentially facilitating long-term cooperative exchanges. Testing for the role of social bonds in increasing predictability of sharing behaviour, a feature frequently overlooked, may help us to identify the evolutionary drivers of resource sharing and mechanisms that sustain delayed reciprocity between non-kin. © 2018 The Authors.","tags":[],"title":"Social bonds facilitate cooperative resource sharing in wild chimpanzees","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.

Several hypotheses, based mainly on observational data, aim to explain how post-conflict (PC) affiliations, such as reconciliation and consolation, resolve conflicts by restoring relationships and/or alleviating anxiety. To examine a potential endocrinological mechanism of PC affiliations, we used an experimental-like procedure to investigate whether the oxytocinergic system is activated during naturally observed reconciliations, receiving bystander PC affiliations and aggressions not followed by PC affiliations in wild male chimpanzees. We compared urinary oxytocin (uOT) levels after reconciliations, receiving bystander PC affiliations or aggressions without affiliations with two control conditions: affiliations without previous aggression and after time periods without social interactions. We furthermore tested the ‘valuable relationship’ hypothesis of reconciliation, as well as the influence of relationship quality between individuals engaged in each of the three behavioral conditions involving aggression on uOT levels. We found that the probability to reconcile a conflict increased with increasing relationship quality between opponents, thus our results support the ‘valuable relationship’ hypothesis. However, relationship quality did not influence uOT levels, while behavioral condition had a significant effect on uOT levels. uOT levels after reconciliations, receiving bystander PC affiliations and affiliations not related to conflicts were higher than after aggressions alone and time periods without social interactions. Overall, our results indicate that the oxytocinergic system is activated during affiliative interactions, whether occurring as reconciliation, bystander PC affiliation or affiliation alone. We conclude that the oxytocinergic system, in addition to building and maintaining social relationships, also takes part in repairing them. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","tags":[],"title":"Urinary oxytocin levels in relation to post-conflict affiliations in wild male chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.

Grooming limits bystanders’ grooming access and ensuing alliances could threaten the bystander’s hierarchy rank or their previous investment in the groomers. To gain a competitive advantage, bystanders could intervene into a grooming bout to increase their own grooming access or to prevent the negative impact of others’ grooming. We tested the impact of dominance rank and social relationships on grooming intervention likelihood and outcome in two sympatric primate species, Western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) and sooty mangabeys (Cercocebus atys atys). In both species, rather than increasing their own access to preferred partners, bystanders intervened mainly when an alliance between groomers could have a negative impact on them: when the lower-ranking groomer was close to the bystander in rank, when either groomer was an affiliation partner whose services they could lose, or the groomers were not yet strongly affiliated with each other. Thus, bystanders in both species appear to monitor grooming interactions and intervene based on their own dominance rank and social relationships, as well as triadic awareness of the relationship between groomers. While the motivation to intervene did not differ between species, mangabeys appeared to be more constrained by dominance rank than chimpanzees. © 2017 The Authors.","tags":[],"title":"Bystanders intervene to impede grooming in western chimpanzees and sooty mangabeys","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.R.

It has, however, never been demonstrated directly in a non-human primate, leading to the suggestion that it evolved in the human lineage after divergence from great apes. Here, we provide the first evidence for real-time, dynamic and interactive vocal fold control in a great ape during an imitation do-as-I-do game with a human demonstrator. Notably, the orang-utan subject skilfully produced wookies-an idiosyncratic vocalization exhibiting a unique spectral profile among the orang-utan vocal repertoire. The subject instantaneously matched human-produced wookies as they were randomly modulated in pitch, adjusting his voice frequency up or down when the human demonstrator did so, readily generating distinct low vs. high frequency sub-variants. These sub-variants were significantly different from spontaneous ones (not produced in matching trials). Results indicate a latent capacity for vocal fold exercise in a great ape (i) in real-time, (ii) up and down the frequency spectrum, (iii) across a register range beyond the species-repertoire and, (iv) in a co-operative turntaking social setup. Such ancestral capacity likely provided the neuro-behavioural basis of the more fine-tuned vocal fold control that is a human hallmark.","tags":[],"title":"Vocal fold control beyond the species-specific repertoire in an orang-utan","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.

In primates, recognition of other group members can be based on individual differences in the voice, but these cues are typically too subtle for human observers. We applied a combined mechanism consisting of a call feature extraction (mel frequency cepstral coefficients) and pattern recognition algorithm (artificial neural networks) to investigate whether automated caller identification is possible in free-ranging primates. The mechanism was tested for its accuracy in recognizing species, call type and caller identity in a large population of free-ranging blue monkeys, Cercopithecus mitis stuhlmanni, in Budongo Forest, Uganda. Classification was highly accurate with 96% at the species, 98% at the call type and 73% at the caller level. It also outperformed conventional discriminant function analysis in the individual recognition task. We conclude that software based on this method will make a powerful tool for future animal behaviour research, as it allows for automatic, fast and objective classifications in different animal species. © 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","tags":[],"title":"A method for automated individual, species and call type recognition in free-ranging animals","type":"publication"}]
