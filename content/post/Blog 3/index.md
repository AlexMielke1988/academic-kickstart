Every year on 14th July, we celebrate World Chimpanzee Day to commemorate the day that Jane Goodall first followed the Gombe chimpanzees, but more importantly we want to raise awareness for the horrible fact that chimpanzees, our closest living relatives, face extinction in the wild across Africa. 

This year, our lab in Oxford (https://primobevolab.web.ox.ac.uk/) teamed up with a group from the University of Exeter to create a series of videos that are supposed to inform a general public about chimpanzees and the many wonderful people who study them. There are videos on what chimpanzees eat, how they make friends, and how we know so much about them.

Have a look!
